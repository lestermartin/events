## Description

Data products are a curated collection of purpose-built and reusable data sets with business-approved metadata designed to solve specific, targeted business problems. The best part about data products? A powerful feature is that they can be built with SQL, but data engineers can also construct them with Python. The PyStarburst API allows data engineers to leverage their existing Dataframe API skills to surface data products as well. In this hands-on, instructor-led lab, you will build Python-based federated data pipelines for your data lake and create curated data products ready to be distributed to downstream consumers. After using data discovery features available in Starburst Galaxy, participants will build an end-to-end programmatic data pipeline of data transformations and the creation of data products.
