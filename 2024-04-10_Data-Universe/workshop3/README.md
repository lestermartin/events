## Description

Data products are a curated collection of purpose-built and reusable data sets with business-approved metadata designed to solve specific, targeted business problems. The best part about data products? They can be built with the standard ANSI SQL we all know and love. In this hands-on, instructor-led lab, you will build SQL federated data pipelines within your data lake and create curated data products ready to be distributed to downstream consumers. Experience a full end-to-end SQL data pipeline from data discovery, data transformations, the creation of data products, and implementing the security and governance required to publish those data products through role-based access control.
