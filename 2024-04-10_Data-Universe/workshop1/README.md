## Description

The data lakehouse architecture has taken the analytics world by storm, applying critical data warehouse-like capabilities to the cloud data lake, and enabling an entirely new era of possibilities over the traditional data warehouse or legacy data lake architectures of the past. To achieve this desired result, you need to select a key component to power your lakehouse - a query engine. In this workshop, you will easily build and manage an open data lakehouse architecture powered by the query engine Trino to support your growing analytics. Trino is an open source highly parallel and distributed query engine built from the ground up at Facebook for efficient, low-latency analytics. You will then combine your query engine with a modern table format, low-cost object storage, and proper security and governance to build out a model data lakehouse. In this session, you will configure and build your own data lakehouse by connecting to multiple data sources, transforming your data, and producing a final output ready to be utilized by downstream consumers.
